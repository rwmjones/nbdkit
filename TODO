To-do list for nbdkit
======================================================================

General ideas for improvements
------------------------------

* Listen on specific interfaces or protocols (eg. only IPv6).

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Exit on last connection (the default behaviour of qemu-nbd unless
  you use -t).

* Limit number of incoming connections (like qemu-nbd -e).

* For parallel plugins, only create threads on demand from parallel
  client requests, rather than pre-creating all threads at connection
  time, up to the thread pool size limit.  Of course, once created, a
  thread is reused as possible until the connection closes.

* Async callbacks.  The current parallel support requires one thread
  per pending message; a solution with fewer threads would split
  low-level code between request and response, where the callback has
  to inform nbdkit when the response is ready:
  https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2018-January/msg00149.html

* More NBD protocol features. Qemu has implemented Structured Replies,
  which allows for more efficient serving of sparse files.  Also in
  the upstream pipeline: proposals for block status and online resize.

* Add a callback to let plugins request minimum alignment for the
  buffer to pread/pwrite; useful for a plugin utilizing O_DIRECT or
  other situation where pre-aligned buffers are more efficient.
  Ideally, a blocksize filter would honor strict alignment below and
  advertise loose alignment above; all other filters (particularly
  ones like offset) can fail to initialize if they can't guarantee
  strict alignment and don't want to deal with bounce buffers.

* Add per-connection caching of .can_FOO callbacks (we already have
  some: .can_write is only called once, but .can_fua is called on
  every request with the FUA flag set).

* Test that zero-length read/write requests behave correctly
  (NBD protocol says they are unspecified).

* Test and document how to run nbdkit from inetd and xinetd in
  nbdkit-service(1).

* Validate that requests which are forwarded by filters are not out of
  range.  This is harder than it looks because filters don't "know"
  the size of the layer below (unless they call .get_size, but that
  might be expensive).  This gets particularly tricky if you assume
  that .get_size cannot be cached and/or might change per-connection,
  although the rest of nbdkit doesn't behave well in that case either.

* Similarly validate the filters don't forward write requests to
  read-only plugins.

* Audit the code base to get rid of strerror() usage (the function is
  not thread-safe); however, using geterror_r() can be tricky as it
  has a different signature in glibc than in POSIX.

* Teach nbdkit_error() to have smart newline appending (for existing
  inconsistent clients), while fixing internal uses to omit the
  newline. Commit ef4f72ef has some ideas on smart newlines, but that
  should probably be factored into a utility function.

* We may need a way to lock nbdkit into memory and adjust the OOM
  killer score.  See this LKML discussion:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1933394.html
  and also look at the implementation of the -swap option in
  nbd-client.

Suggestions for plugins
-----------------------

Note: qemu supports other formats such as libssh, libnfs, iscsi,
gluster and ceph/rbd, and while similar plugins could be written for
nbdkit there is no compelling reason unless the result is better than
qemu-nbd.  For the majority of users it would be better if they were
directed to qemu-nbd for these use cases.

* XVA files

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-11/msg02971.html
  is a partial solution but it needs cleaning up.

nbdkit-nbd-plugin could use enhancements:

* FUA passthrough, rather than extra FLUSH calls.  For this, .can_fua
  must be exposed to plugins (not just filters), and needs to be
  tri-state rather than just bool.

* Enable client-side TLS (right now, the nbd plugin allows us to
  support an encrypted client connecting to a plain server; but we
  would need TLS to support a plain client connecting to an encrypted
  server).

* Support for connecting to a server over IP rather than just Unix
  sockets.

nbdkit-floppy-plugin:

* Add boot sector support.  In theory this is easy (eg. using
  SYSLINUX), but the practical reality of making a fully bootable
  floppy is rather more complex.

* Add multiple dir merging.

nbdkit-linuxdisk-plugin:

* Add multiple dir merging (in e2fsprogs mke2fs).

Suggestions for filters
-----------------------

* tar plugin should really be a filter

* gzip plugin should really be a filter

* libarchive could be used to implement a general tar/zip filter

* LUKS encrypt/decrypt filter, bonus points if compatible with qemu
  LUKS-encrypted disk images

* masking plugin features for testing clients (see 'nozero' and 'fua'
  filters for examples)

* nbdkit-cache-filter should handle ENOSPC errors automatically by
  reclaiming blocks from the cache

Filters for security
--------------------

Things like blacklisting or whitelisting IP addresses can be done
using external wrappers (TCP wrappers, systemd).

However it might be nice to have a configurable filter for preventing
valid but not sensible requests.  The server already filters invalid
requests.  This would be like seccomp, and could be implemented using
an eBPF-based parser.  Unfortunately actual eBPF is difficult to use
for userspace processes.  The "standard" isn't solidly defined - the
Linux kernel implementation is the standard - and Linux has by far the
best implementation, particularly around bytecode verification and
JITting.  There is a userspace VM (ubpf) but it has very limited
capabilities compared to Linux.

Composing nbdkit
----------------

Filters allow certain types of composition, but others would not be
possible, for example RAIDing over multiple nbd sources.  Because the
plugin API limits us to loading a single plugin to the server, the
best way to do this (and the most robust) is to compose multiple
nbdkit processes.

The nbd plugin (plugins/nbd) already contains an NBD client, so we
could factor this client out and make it available to other plugins to
use.

Build-related
-------------

* Move servers/proto* into common/ via a convenience library, so that
  the nbd plugin doesn't trigger Automake warnings about using an
  object in a subdirectory.

* Figure out how to get 'make distcheck' working. VPATH builds are
  working, but various pkg-config results that try to stick
  bash-completion and ocaml add-ons into their system-wide home do
  not play nicely with --prefix builds for a non-root user.

* Port to Windows.

Rust plugins
------------

* Consider supporting a more idiomatic style for writing Rust plugins.

* Better documentation.

* Add tests.

* There is no attempt to ‘make install’ or otherwise package the
  crate.  Since it looks as if Rust code is normally distributed as
  source it's not clear what that would even mean.
